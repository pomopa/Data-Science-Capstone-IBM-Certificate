# 🚀 SpaceY Data Science Project

##  Author: Pol Monné Parera

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases the hands-on labs i developed as part of the Applied Data Science Capstone course offered by IBM on Coursera in my path to obtaining the IBM Data Scientist Professional certification they offer on the same site.

The project focuses on **SpaceY**, a fictional company aiming to compete with **SpaceX** by leveraging **predictive analytics** to determine the **landing success of rocket launches before they occur**, helping reduce operational costs 🤑.
